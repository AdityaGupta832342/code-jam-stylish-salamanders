# Terminal Board
This is an application made as a submission for the PyDis Code Jam 2021.

The theme for the code jam is "Think inside the box."

## What is our program?
We interpreted the theme as a form of boundaries, and one of the most common limitations of the terminal is the inability to use and create graphics. This is why we created a board for brainstorming, drawing, whatever the user wants to do - but only within the box of the terminal window. Aside from having to 'think inside the box', the only limit is the user's imagination.
