# Terminal Board
This is an application made as a submission for the PyDis Code Jam 2021.

The theme for the code jam is "Think inside the box."

## What is our program?
We interpreted the theme as a form of limitations and boundaries, and one of the common limitation of the terminal is the inability to do graphical stuff. So we decided to allow the user to do whatever they want to, inside the box(Terminal window). They could draw, paint and the only limitation aside from the boundaries of the window, is your imagination.

## Installation
Please install the requirements using the command below
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
